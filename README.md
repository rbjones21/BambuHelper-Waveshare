# BambuHelper

Dedicated Bambu Lab printer monitor built with ESP32-S3 Super Mini and a 1.54" 240x240 color TFT display (ST7789).

Connects to your printer via MQTT over TLS and displays a real-time dashboard with arc gauges, animations, and live stats.

### Supported Printers

| Connection Mode | Printers | How it connects |
|---|---|---|
| **LAN Direct** | P1P, P1S, X1, X1C, X1E, A1, A1 Mini | Local MQTT via printer IP + LAN access code |
| **Bambu Cloud** | H2C, H2D, H2S, P2S | Cloud MQTT via Bambu account login |
| **Bambu Cloud (All printers)** | Any Bambu printer | Cloud MQTT — no LAN mode needed |

> **Tip:** Use "Bambu Cloud (All printers)" if you don't want to enable LAN mode on your printer (e.g. to keep Bambu Handy working), or if your ESP32 is on a different network than the printer.

### Cloud Mode Security Notice

When using Bambu Cloud, BambuHelper connects through Bambu Lab's cloud MQTT service. This requires a one-time login with your Bambu Lab account credentials. Here's what you need to know:

- **Your email and password are NOT stored** on the device. They are sent directly to Bambu Lab's official API (`api.bambulab.com`) over HTTPS, exactly the same way Bambu Studio and Bambu Handy do it.
- **Only an auth token is stored** in the ESP32's flash memory. This token expires after ~3 months, at which point you simply re-login via the web interface.
- **Read-only access** — BambuHelper only reads printer status. It never sends commands or modifies printer settings.
- **Same approach as other community projects** — this is the same authentication method used by the [Home Assistant Bambu Lab integration](https://github.com/greghesp/ha-bambulab) (15,000+ users), [OctoPrint-Bambu](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-Bambu), and other trusted third-party tools.

## Flashing

1. Download the latest `BambuHelper-WebFlasher.bin` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Open [ESP Web Flasher](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/) in Chrome or Edge
3. Connect your ESP32-S3 via USB
4. Click **Connect** and select your device
5. Set flash address to **0x0**
6. Select the downloaded `.bin` file
7. Click **Program**

## Setup

1. **Flash** the firmware (see above)
2. **Connect** to the `BambuHelper-XXXX` WiFi network (password: `bambu1234`)
3. **Open** `192.168.4.1` in your browser
4. **Enter** your home WiFi credentials
5. **Choose connection mode:**

   **LAN Direct** (P1P, P1S, X1, X1C, X1E, A1, A1 Mini):
   - Printer IP address (found in printer Settings > Network)
   - Serial number
   - LAN access code (8 characters, from printer Settings > Network)

   **Bambu Cloud** (H2C, H2D, H2S, P2S) or **Bambu Cloud (All printers)**:
   - **Option A: Direct login** — Click "Login to Bambu Cloud" and enter your Bambu Lab account email and password. Enter the 6-digit verification code sent to your email (if 2FA is enabled). Select your printer from the dropdown list.
   - **Option B: Paste token** — If direct login fails (Cloudflare may block ESP32), get your token using the Python helper script and paste it into the "Paste Token" field. See [Getting a Cloud Token](#getting-a-cloud-token) below.

6. **Save** - the device restarts and connects to your printer

### Getting a Cloud Token

If direct cloud login from the ESP32 is blocked by Cloudflare, you can get your token on a PC and paste it:

**Using the Python helper script (recommended):**
```bash
pip install curl_cffi
python tools/get_token.py
```
The script will prompt for your email, password, and 2FA code, then print the token. Copy and paste it into BambuHelper's web interface.

**Using browser DevTools (Chrome / Edge):**
1. Open https://bambulab.com and log in to your account
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to the **Application** tab (click `>>` if you don't see it)
4. In the left sidebar, expand **Cookies** → click `https://bambulab.com`
5. Find the row named `token` in the cookie list
6. Double-click the **Value** cell to select it, then **Ctrl+C** to copy
7. Paste the value into BambuHelper's "Paste Token" field in the web interface

**Using browser DevTools (Firefox):**
1. Open https://bambulab.com and log in to your account
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to the **Storage** tab
4. In the left sidebar, expand **Cookies** → click `https://bambulab.com`
5. Find the row named `token`
6. Double-click the **Value** cell to select it, then **Ctrl+C** to copy
7. Paste the value into BambuHelper's "Paste Token" field

**Using browser DevTools (Safari):**
1. Open https://bambulab.com and log in to your account
2. Open **Develop** → **Show Web Inspector** (enable the Develop menu first in Safari Preferences → Advanced)
3. Go to the **Storage** tab → **Cookies** → `bambulab.com`
4. Find and copy the `token` value
5. Paste it into BambuHelper's "Paste Token" field

> **Note:** The token is valid for approximately 3 months. When it expires, the ESP32 will fail to connect — simply repeat the process above to get a new token. Make sure to select the correct **Server Region** (US/EU/CN) in the web interface to match your Bambu account's region.

## Web Interface

The built-in web interface (accessible at the device's IP address) provides the following settings:

### WiFi Settings
- **SSID** - your home WiFi network name
- **Password** - WiFi password

### Network
- **IP Assignment** - choose between DHCP (automatic) or Static IP
- **Static IP fields** (when static is selected):
  - IP Address
  - Gateway
  - Subnet Mask
  - DNS Server
- **Show IP at startup** - display the assigned IP on screen for 3 seconds after WiFi connects (on by default)

### Printer Settings
- **Enable Monitoring** - toggle printer connection on/off
- **Connection Mode** - LAN Direct, Bambu Cloud (H2/P2S), or Bambu Cloud (All printers)
- **LAN mode fields:**
  - Printer Name, Printer IP Address, Serial Number, LAN Access Code
- **Cloud mode fields:**
  - Bambu account login (email + password + optional 2FA)
  - Printer selection from your account's device list
- **Live Stats** - real-time nozzle/bed temp, progress, fan speed, and connection status

### Display
- **Brightness** - backlight level (10–255)
- **Screen Rotation** - 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°
- **Display off after print complete** - minutes to show the finish screen before turning off the display (0 = never turn off, default: 3 minutes)
- **Keep display always on** - override the timeout and never turn off

### Gauge Colors
- **Theme presets** - Default, Mono Green, Neon, Warm, Ocean
- **Background color** - display background
- **Track color** - inactive arc background
- **Per-gauge colors** (arc, label, value) for:
  - Progress
  - Nozzle temperature
  - Bed temperature
  - Part fan
  - Aux fan
  - Chamber fan

### Other
- **Factory Reset** - erases all settings and restarts

## Dashboard Screens

| Screen | When |
|---|---|
| Splash | Boot (2 seconds) |
| AP Mode | First boot / no WiFi configured |
| Connecting WiFi | Attempting WiFi connection |
| WiFi Connected | Shows IP for 3s (if enabled) |
| Connecting Printer | WiFi connected, waiting for MQTT |
| Idle | Connected, printer not printing |
| Printing | Active print with full dashboard |
| Finished | Print complete with animation (auto-off after timeout) |
| Display Off | After finish timeout or printer powered off |

## Display Power Management

- After a print completes, the finish screen is shown for a configurable duration (default: 3 minutes), then the display and backlight turn off to save power.
- When the printer is powered off or disconnected, the display stays off.
- When the printer comes back online or starts a new print, the display automatically wakes up.
- The "Keep display always on" option overrides the auto-off behavior.
- The web interface shows the current display state (on/off) in the live status section.
